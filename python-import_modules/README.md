# Python Import & Modules

This directory contains exercises and scripts related to Python modules and importing functionality. The tasks demonstrate how to import functions from other files, use built-in modules, and organize code for better reusability and clarity.

## Files

- **0-add.py**: Imports the `add` function from `add_0.py` and prints the sum of two integers.
- **add_0.py**: Provides a simple `add` function for addition.
- Additional scripts may demonstrate importing, using built-in modules, and more.

## Usage

Make sure each script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script_name.py
```
